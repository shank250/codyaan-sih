## About the Project

### Problems in Current Grievance System:
- **Complex Forms:** The process of filling out forms is overly complicated and time-consuming, with redundant and confusing overlaps.
- **Corruption Delays:** Corruption within the system causes delays, hindering victims from obtaining timely justice.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The lack of transparency leads to uncertainty regarding the status of complaints.
- **Communication Barriers:** Language barriers hinder effective communication between users and the grievance system.
- **Limited Access in Rural Areas:** Rural areas face limited access to the grievance system, often due to a lack of knowledge regarding grievances.

- **Efficient Case Tracking:** Utilize a digital platform for efficient tracking of cases, providing users with real-time updates on the status of their complaints.
- **Smart Education Distribution:** Distribute smart education materials regarding grievances to empower users with knowledge and understanding.
- **Timely Assistance:** Victims can receive timely assistance, ensuring a swift and effective resolution process.
